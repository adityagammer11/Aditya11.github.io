  		<h4>True friends can see the hurt in your eyes when everyone else is fooled by your smile.</h4><hr>

  		<h4>A friend is someone who understand your past, believes in your future, and accepts you today just the way you are.</h4><hr>
      <h3>Your best friend is the one who's laughed with you, cried with you, and despaired with you. Your best friend is the one who loves and accepts all the strange or quirky things about you. Your best friend is the one who's shirts are stained with mascara from your tears. Your best friend is the one who can look at you and have a whole conversation without moving their mouth once. Your best friend is the one who's seen you at your worst, and said you were the best. Your best friend is the one who fought for and defended you-even when they knew you were wrong. Your best friend is the one who can honestly say "I love you." and not think twice about how it was taken. Your best friend is the one who crashes on your couch at four in the morning. Your best friend is the one who kicked you in the ass and straightened you out when you were about to make a big mistake. Your best friend is the one who knows you inside out. Your best friend is the one who never has to ask- they already know the answer. Your best friend is the one with whom you can't play twenty questions because they already know the answer to every question. Your best friend is the one who fought with you, missed you, and made up with you after many bitter exchanges were made. Your best friend is the one who stood by your side when you were having a hard time, and always forgave you for being a b*tch. Your best friend is the one who doesn't expect an apology but deserves one. Your best friend is the one who covered for you to keep you out of serious trouble. Your best friend is the one who never judged you for what you had done, never called you a dirty name because you had been less than good. Your best friend is the one who is your main partner in crime. Your best friend is the one who will always need you and miss you in times of need when you can't be there, but knows you would be if it was possible. Your best friend is the one whom you may need most, who will always seek your company, but will push you away to avoid pulling you down with them when they know they can't win.</h3>
